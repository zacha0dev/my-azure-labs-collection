# Custom Services
This section contains custom-developed solutions that can be deployed on Azure VMs or integrated into lab environments. These services act as plug-ins to replicate real-world scenarios and enable advanced testing for Azure networking and application workflows.

## Overview
Each solution is designed to:
- Be lightweight and modular.
- Support interactive control for local testing.
- Serve as building blocks for more complex lab setups.

### Solutions 

| Solution | Note | 
| --- | --- |
| [My Azure API](./my-azure-api/.my-azure-api.md) | A FastAPI-based API ervice for testing API behaviors, fault injection, and backend integrations. Includes health checks and plans for database and proxy plugins. |
| [My Azure Frontend](./my-azure-frontend/.my-azure-frontend.md) |  Flask-based dashboard for visualizing and managing lab services. Includes a TailwindCSS UI, health monitoring for Router and API, route management, and in-memory authentication with user registration. |
| [My Azure Router](./my-azure-router/.my-azure-router.md) | A Python-based router prototype for simulating routing flows and validating network scenarios in Azure. |

## Roadmap 
- These solutions will be deployable to Azure Virtual Machines for hosting and end-to-end testing in real-world scenarios.
