# Custom Services
This section contains custom-developed solutions that can be deployed on Azure VMs or integrated into lab environments. These services act as plug-ins to replicate real-world scenarios and enable advanced testing for Azure networking and application workflows.

## Overview
Each solution is designed to:
- Be lightweight and modular.
- Support interactive control for local testing.
- Serve as building blocks for more complex lab setups.
