# My Azure API
The **My Azure API** is a modular FastAPI-based service designed for testing API behaviors, backend integrations, and fault injection scenarios in Azure environments. It serves as a foundation for building and validating microservice patterns before deploying production-grade solutions.


### Run Locally 
- To explore the router you can run this locally. 
- Ensure you are in the API folder: `cd .\custom-services\my-azure-api\`.
- Run `python start_api.py`.
- Once you see `api> [api] Starting FastAPI on 127.0.0.1:8080`, the API is live.
- You can then open http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz from the browser to see it running. 

### API Documentation
FastAPI provides interactive documentation automatically:

- Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs
- ReDoc: http://127.0.0.1:8080/redoc

Use these to:
- Explore all available endpoints.
- Test requests directly from the browser.
- View request/response schemas and validation rules.
