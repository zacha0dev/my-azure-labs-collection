# My Azure Router 
The **My Azure Router** is a lightweight, Python-based prototype designed for testing routing scenarios in Azure environments. It provides a simple framework to simulate routing flows and handle small amounts of test traffic, making it ideal for validating concepts before deploying more complex networking solutions.

### Run Locally 
- To explore the router you can run this locally. 
- Ensure you are in the router folder: `cd .\custom-services\my-azure-router\`.
- Run `python start_router.py`.
- After you see `router> [router] Router process starting ...`, you can send a command to the router process. 
- You can interact with the router using commands such as: `start`, `stop`, `kill`, `router-status`, `q` or `quit`.
