# My Azure Router 
This is a lightweight custom router that uses python to setup a router that can be used to test more advanced routing scenario's. This project is a simple based python router prototype. The goal is to handle small amouts of test traffic in order to test example routing flows through Azure environments.

### Run Locally 
- To explore the router you can run this locally. 
- Ensure you are in the router folder: `cd .\custom-services\my-azure-router\`.
- Run `python start_router.py`.
- After you see `router> [router] Router process starting ...`, you can send a command to the router process.
