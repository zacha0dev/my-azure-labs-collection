# My Azure Frontend 
The **My Azure Frontend** is a lightweight, Flask-based dashboard designed to visualize and interact with your lab services (Router, API, and future modules). It provides a simple UI for health monitoring, route management, and user authentication, making it ideal for building and testing Azure networking scenarios in a controlled environment

- Navigate to the frontend folder: `cd .\custom-services\my-azure-frontend\`.
- Run `python start_frontend.py`.
